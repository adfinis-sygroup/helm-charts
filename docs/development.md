## Development

### Workflow

```bash
# clone repo
git clone git@github.com:adfinis-sygroup/helm-charts.git
cd helm-charts

# add personal fork to working copy
git remote add $FORK_NAME $FORK_GIT_REPO

# fetch origin before branching
git fetch origin

# switch to feature branch
git switch -c feat/my-feature origin/master

# do changes
vim charts/

# stage changes for commit
git add -p

# run pre-commit
pre-commit run -a

# restage changes
git add -p

# check changes
git diff --cached

# commit using commitizen
git cz

# or with plain git commit
git commit

# push to fork
git push $FORK_NAME

# add changes to last commit and force push
pre-commit run -a
git add -p
git commit --amend
git push $FORK_NAME --force-with-lease
```

### Testing

A considerable amount of tests run on GitHub Actions on each push to the helm-charts repo. These should
check for basic deployability and functionality of the charts. You should look at the test results while
you are working on a pull request as they often contain log output that can help surface errors.

You can run most of the tests locally if you would like to, please refer to the [hack/ci](../hack/ci)
directory for examples on how to do so.

Before commiting you should test your changes using `helm template`. The charts usually have a few YAML
files that can help you do so.
* `ci/*-values.yaml` contains the values used in ci
* `examples/*.yaml` contains examples used by the docs

You can look at manifests using these:
```bash
helm template \
  -f charts/infra-apps/ci/default-values.yaml \
  -f charts/infra-apps/examples/argocd.yaml \
  charts/infra-apps
```

In most cases you will want to test a variety of cases. If your case isn't covered yet, consider adding
a new case to the charts `ci/` folder (based on `defaults-values.yaml`). You can also add your use-cases
to the `examples/` folder.

### Documentation

Most README files are autogenerated. Use `pre-commit` or the tools
in [hack/](../hack) to regenerate them.

More information is in the [documentation](./documentation.md) docs.

### pre-commit hook

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate some tasks like
generating README files.

#### pre-commit requirements

* [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)
* [gomplate](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate)

#### pre-commit configuration

After installing the pre-commit requirements you can initialize pre-commit.

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install-hooks
```
